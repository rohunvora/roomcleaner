## Project Overview

Room Cleaner is an iOS app designed to help people with ADHD clean their rooms using computer vision to identify items and provide bite-sized cleaning tasks. The project includes both a native iOS app (SwiftUI) and a Next.js landing page.

## Development Commands

### iOS App Development
```bash
# Open project in Xcode
open RoomCleaner/RoomCleaner.xcodeproj

# Build and run through Xcode UI (Cmd+R)
# Target: iOS 16+
```

### Landing Page Development
```bash
cd landing
npm install       # Install dependencies
npm run dev       # Start development server (localhost:3000)
vercel            # Deploy to production
```

### Vision Testing
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-key'
python3 test_vision.py  # Test GPT-4 Vision accuracy
```

## Architecture & Structure

### iOS App Architecture (MVVM)

**State Management:**
- Single `AppState` class manages all app state with `@Published` properties
- Environment object pattern for global state access
- Phase-based flow: `welcome → scanning → analyzing → labeling → cleaning → completed`

**Key Components:**
- `RoomScanViewModel`: Handles room scanning and photo management
- `MultiPassVisionAnalyzer`: 4-pass detection system for 90%+ accuracy
- `AppState`: Central state management with phase tracking
- Views are in `Views/` directory, organized by app phase

**Multi-Pass Detection System:**
- Pass 1: General objects
- Pass 2: Small/cluttered items
- Pass 3: Textiles/soft materials
- Pass 4: Partially visible objects
- Smart deduplication prevents duplicate items

### Landing Page Structure

Next.js 13+ app with:
- Supabase for waitlist storage
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Optional Mailgun/Slack integrations

## Important Configuration

### iOS App
1. **Enable Demo Mode** for testing without API calls:
   ```swift
   // In MockData.swift
   static let demoMode = true  // Set to false for production
   ```

2. **Add OpenAI API Key** when ready:
   ```swift
   // In MultiPassVisionAnalyzer.swift
   private let apiKey = "your-openai-api-key"
   ```

### Landing Page
Configure environment variables in `landing/.env.local`:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=
MAILGUN_API_KEY= (optional)
SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL= (optional)
```

## Key Implementation Details

### Detection & Labeling Flow
1. User takes 4+ photos of their room from different angles
2. Multi-pass vision analyzer processes each photo
3. Items are deduplicated across all photos
4. Manual addition UI allows adding missed items
5. Each item becomes a cleaning task

### ADHD-Optimized Features
- Bite-sized tasks (one item at a time)
- Visual progress tracking
- Celebration animations on completion
- No overwhelming task lists
- Focus on "what" not "how" to clean

### Testing Approach
- Use demo mode for UI development/testing
- Test images available in `test_images/` directory
- `TestHarness/` contains vision accuracy testing utilities
- No unit tests currently - testing done through UI

## Development Workflow

1. **For UI changes**: Enable demo mode and use Xcode simulator
2. **For vision changes**: Test with `test_vision.py` first
3. **For new features**: Follow existing MVVM pattern
4. **For landing page**: Standard Next.js development flow

## Current Implementation Status

**Working:**
- Complete app flow from scanning to celebration
- Multi-pass detection system (placeholder implementation)
- Manual item addition UI
- Demo mode with realistic mock data
- Landing page with waitlist

**Needs Implementation:**
- Real OpenAI API integration (currently returns mock data)
- Data persistence between sessions
- Before/after photo comparisons
- Voice search for finding specific items

## Animated Detection Effect for Landing Page

### Background and Motivation

The current landing page uses a static SVG hero image to demonstrate the app's functionality. However, inspired by the LEGO detection app and Fabric.so's approach, we want to create an interactive, animated demonstration that:

1. **Shows the AI in action** - Visual feedback of items being detected in real-time
2. **Builds trust** - Users can see exactly how the detection works
3. **Creates engagement** - Animation keeps visitors interested
4. **Demonstrates value** - Shows the comprehensive nature of detection

The animation will replace/enhance the current hero image section and provide a more compelling visual representation of the Room Cleaner app's core functionality.

### User Journey

1. **Visitor lands on page** → Sees hero section with a realistic messy room photo
2. **Animation auto-starts** → Detection boxes begin appearing over items in the room
3. **Visual feedback** → Each box has a color-coded category and fades in with a subtle animation
4. **Counter increments** → Shows "X items detected" counting up as boxes appear
5. **Completion state** → After all items detected, shows "Ready to organize" CTA
6. **Interaction options** → User can replay animation or see different room examples

### User Stories

**As a visitor with ADHD:**
- I want to see how the app identifies items in a messy room so I can trust it will work for my space
- I want to see the detection happen gradually so I can understand the process
- I want to see different types of items being detected so I know it's comprehensive

**As a skeptical user:**
- I want to see real examples of detection, not just marketing claims
- I want to understand what kinds of items the app can identify
- I want to see that the app won't miss important items

**As a mobile visitor:**
- I want the animation to work smoothly on my device without performance issues
- I want to be able to pause/replay if I missed something
- I want the demo to load quickly without blocking the page

### High-level Task Breakdown

### Key Challenges and Analysis

**1. Performance on Mobile Devices**
- Challenge: Animating 30-40 elements simultaneously could cause frame drops
- Solution: Use CSS transforms only, implement progressive rendering, consider reducing item count on mobile

**2. Coordination with Existing Design**
- Challenge: New component must fit seamlessly with current neon-green aesthetic
- Solution: Reuse existing color variables, match animation timing with current float/pulse effects

**3. Data Structure for Detections**
- Challenge: Need realistic positioning data that works across different screen sizes
- Solution: Use percentage-based positioning, create data for 16:9 aspect ratio and scale accordingly

**4. Accessibility Concerns**
- Challenge: Animation could be distracting or cause motion sickness
- Solution: Implement pause controls, respect prefers-reduced-motion, provide text alternative

**5. Loading Performance**
- Challenge: Don't want to slow down initial page load
- Solution: Lazy load component, use native loading="lazy" for images, consider using React.lazy()

- Dynamic captions that adapt based on animation state
- Clear, action-oriented language throughout

✅ **Performance Optimizations:**
- Lazy loading reduces initial bundle size
- Optimized image loading with proper sizing
- CSS transforms ensure 60fps animations
- Render optimizations prevent layout thrashing

✅ **Accessibility Features:**

- Alternative text for reduced motion users
- Proper ARIA labels and semantic HTML

**Milestone Achievement:**
The detection demo successfully demonstrates the Room Cleaner app's core value proposition through an engaging, performant animation that builds trust and showcases the AI's capabilities. The implementation follows all best practices and maintains the high-quality standards requested.

### Lessons

**TypeScript Module Resolution in Next.js:**
- When creating new components in Next.js, TypeScript may show "Cannot find module" errors for local imports
- These errors typically resolve at build time when Next.js processes the modules
- The dev server handles module resolution properly even if the IDE shows warnings

**Performance Optimization Pattern:**
- Always use React.lazy() with Suspense for heavy components that aren't immediately visible
- Provide meaningful loading states that match the component's eventual size to prevent layout shift
- Use Next.js Image component over standard img tags for automatic optimization

**Animation Best Practices:**
- Use CSS transforms and opacity for animations (GPU accelerated)
- Add contain: layout style to animated elements to prevent reflow
- Always implement prefers-reduced-motion checks for accessibility
