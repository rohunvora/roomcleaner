## Key Files

### iOS App
- `RoomCleaner/Services/MultiPassVisionAnalyzer.swift` - 4-pass AI detection system
- `RoomCleaner/Models/AppState.swift` - Central state management
- `RoomCleaner/Utilities/MockData.swift` - Demo mode configuration

### Landing Page
- `landing/app/page.tsx` - Main landing page
- `landing/lib/copy.ts` - All website copy in one place
- `landing/components/DetectionDemo.tsx` - Animated detection demo

### Configuration
- `landing/.env.local` - Environment variables (create from .env.example)
- iOS API key configuration in `MultiPassVisionAnalyzer.swift`

## Getting Started

### iOS Development
```bash
# Open in Xcode
open RoomCleaner/RoomCleaner.xcodeproj

# Enable demo mode for UI development (no API calls)
# In MockData.swift: static let demoMode = true
```

### Landing Page Development
```bash
cd landing
npm install
npm run dev  # Runs on http://localhost:3000
```

## Development Status

âœ… **Completed:**
- Full iOS app UI flow
- ADHD-optimized UX
- Landing page with animations
- Mock data system for testing

ðŸš§ **In Progress** (see `.cursor/scratchpad.md` for detailed plan):
- Real OpenAI API integration
- Zone assignment system
- Data persistence
- Visual organization maps

## Testing

```bash
# Test AI detection accuracy
export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-key'
python3 test_vision_v2.py
```

## Deployment

Landing page deploys automatically to Vercel:
- Production: https://roomcleaner.vercel.app
- Preview: Created for each PR

## Contributing

1. Check `.cursor/scratchpad.md` for current development plans
2. Use demo mode for UI development
