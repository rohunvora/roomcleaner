# Vision Detection Test Results

## Executive Summary

After testing GPT-4 Vision on 6 messy room images, here's what we found:

### üìä Current Performance
- **V1 Test**: Average 12.6 objects per image
- **V2 Test**: Average ~20 objects per image (60% improvement)
- **Confidence**: 97% high confidence detections
- **Processing Time**: 15-35 seconds per image

### üéØ Target vs Actual
- **Target**: Detect ‚â•85% of visible objects
- **Current Estimate**: ~40-50% detection rate
- **Gap**: Still missing many small/obscured items

## Key Findings

### ‚úÖ What Works Well
1. **High confidence** - Model is very confident about what it detects
2. **Good labeling** - Specific labels like "pink teddy bear", "Starry Night poster"
3. **Major items** - Reliably detects furniture, large objects, prominent items
4. **Bounding boxes** - Reasonable location data for detected objects

### ‚ùå What Needs Improvement
1. **Quantity** - Only detecting 12-20 objects when rooms likely have 40-60+
2. **Small items** - Missing pens, cables, small papers, coins
3. **Pile detection** - Not separating items in piles/stacks
4. **Floor items** - Under-detecting items on the floor

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions
1. **Multi-pass detection** - Run multiple prompts focusing on different areas:
   - Pass 1: Large/obvious items
   - Pass 2: Small items and details
   - Pass 3: Items in piles/stacks

2. **Image preprocessing** - Enhance contrast, zoom on cluttered areas

3. **Hybrid approach** - Combine with traditional CV for edge detection

### For MVP
Given current ~40-50% detection rate, we can still build a useful product by:
1. **Focus on categories** that work well (clothes, electronics, books)
2. **Let users add missed items** through the UI
3. **Use AI for initial scan**, then user refinement
4. **Group nearby items** into cleaning tasks even if not all detected

## Next Steps

1. **Implement multi-pass detection** in VisionAnalyzer.swift
2. **Add user correction UI** for missed items
3. **Test with real users** to see if 40-50% automation is still valuable
4. **Consider alternative models** (Claude 3.5, specialized vision models)

## Test Data

### V1 Results Summary
- Total objects: 63 across 5 images
- Categories: misc (36%), electronics (17%), furniture (16%)
- Failed: 1 image refused processing

### V2 Improvements
- Better prompting increased detection by ~60%
- More descriptive labels
- Still room for significant improvement

## Conclusion

While we're not at 85% accuracy yet, the current detection is good enough to:
- Provide value to users (automated first pass)
- Build the full app experience
- Iterate based on real usage

The key is designing the UX to gracefully handle missed items while still delivering the core value of breaking down overwhelming messes into manageable tasks.
